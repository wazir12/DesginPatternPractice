A binary tree is a set of 3 Disjoints Sets, where the first subset is called the root and other subsets 
are either empty or themselves binary tree.

Complete Binary Tree(eg Heap)
In A almost Binary tree, each node as added Level by Level.

Representing Complete Binary Tree using 1D array 
    --> Left Element = 2i
    --> Right Element = 2i+1
Heap
    -Heap is complete binary Tree
    -Two types of heap:
        - Min Heap - Root element is smallest than it child elements
        - Max Heap - Root node is greatest than its child nodes
Inserting into a heap:

insertHeap(A[],n):
    //Insert Element at A[n] into heap that is maintained
    //in A[1..n-1]
    i = n
    item = A[i]
    parent = floor(i/2)
    
    // as long as the parent index is valid and the value at parent is less than
    // current item
    while(parent > 0 and A[i]<item)
        {
            A[i] = A[parent]
            i = parent
            parent = floor(i/2)
        }   
     A[i] = item

Delete from Heap:
    deleteHeap(A[], heap_size)
        if(heap_size == 0)
            print "Heap is Empty"
            return -1
        
        //get Content of root in variable
        item = A[1]
        //Copy Content of last node to root
        A[1] = A[heap_size]
        // to Delete the element  reduce heap size by 1
        heap_size = heap_size-1
        //Call Adjust Operation for restoring heap at index 1
        Adjust(A,1,heap_size)
        return item
